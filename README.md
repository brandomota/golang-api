# golang-api
REST API in Golang using [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) and some others libs.

This is only a "my project for bored times", but you are allowed to clone and use, send PR, suggest any change (i started this project to learn Go too),etc.

Have a nice day (or night, is night now ? )

TO-DO (TO-DO is in progress too):

- [ ] Initial struture
- [ ] Routes
- [ ] Database Support
- [ ] Make a minimal CRUD
- [ ] Add Gorbot to control Sphero to play with my cat (the most important feature!)

P.S.: I love motorsports, branch names are circuit names :sweat_smile:
